## The Problem

In distributed publish-subscribe systems (such as ROS 2, Apache Kafka, MQTT, and others), some components are structurally far more critical than others. When they fail, failures cascade through the system. Traditional approaches to identifying these weak points require either expensive runtime monitoring or waiting for production incidents.

This reactive posture has two fundamental problems:
- **Runtime monitoring adds overhead** — dynamic instrumentation imposes latency penalty on production systems that are often latency-sensitive or safety-critical.
- **Production incident reliance** — by the time a critical failure is discovered in production, the damage (data loss, service disruption, financial loss, safety risk) has already occurred.

---

## Core Methodology & Pipeline

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Core Insight:** A component's position in the dependency graph reliably predicts its real-world failure impact — without any runtime data.

Software-as-a-Graph (SaG) operationalizes this insight into a 6-step core analytical pipeline, supported by an offline input preparation stage (Generate). The fundamental claim is that **topological structure alone** — how components are connected, what they depend on, and how strongly — encodes enough information to rank components by their potential failure impact with high statistical fidelity.

| Step | What It Does | Key Output | Documentation |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Offline Prep: Generate** | Produces a synthetic pub-sub topology for experiments, benchmarks, or CI regression tests | Topology JSON (`data/system.json`) | [graph-generation.md](docs/graph-generation.md) |
| **1. Model** | Converts topology JSON into a formal weighted directed graph $G = (V, E, \tau_V, \tau_E, w)$ in Neo4j; derives logical `DEPENDS_ON` edges via six dependency rules; computes QoS-derived weights | $G_{\text{structural}}$ and $G_{\text{analysis}}(l)$ | [graph-model.md](docs/graph-model.md) |
| **2. Analyze** | Deterministic, closed-form.

| **6. Visualize** | Renders interactive dashboards with network graphs, dependency matrices, cascade heatmaps, and RMAV radar charts | `dashboard.html` (fully self-contained) | [visualization.md](docs/visualization.md) |

### Scale Presets

The offline synthetic generator supports six scale presets for rapid experimentation:

| Preset | Apps | Topics | Brokers | Nodes | Libs | Typical Use |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| `tiny` | 5 | 5 | 1 | 2 | 2 | Unit tests |
| `small` | 15 | 10 | 2 | 4 | 5 | Quick checks |
| `medium` | 50 | 30 | 3 | 8 | 10 | Development |
| `large` | 150 | 100 | 6 | 20 | 30 | Integration tests |
| `jumbo` | 300 | 120 | 10 | 40 | 50 | Large-scale benchmarks |
| `xlarge` | 500 | 300 | 10 | 50 | 100 | Performance benchmarks |

> [!NOTE]
> The `cli/generate_graph.py` script produces synthetic pub-sub topologies for evaluation, benchmarking, and reproducible experiments. Real deployments start at Step 1 (Model) with an actual architecture description.

## RMAV Quality Model

The RMAV quality model decomposes criticality into four orthogonal, actionable dimensions. It operates on the derived dependency graph where edges point from *dependent* to *dependency* (e.g., subscriber $\rightarrow$ publisher, application $\rightarrow$ broker).

| Dimension | Question Answered | High Score Means | Primary Stakeholder |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **R — Reliability** | How broadly does failure propagate? | Failure cascades widely and is hard to contain | Reliability Engineer |
| **M — Maintainability** | How hard is this to change safely? | Tightly coupled; structural bottleneck | Software Architect |
| **A — Availability** | Is this a structural single point of failure? | Removing it partitions the dependency graph | DevOps / SRE |
| **V — Vulnerability** | How attractive a target is this for attack? | Central, reachable, high-value downstream | Security Engineer |

### Reliability

Reliability measures how broadly and deeply a component's failure propagates. Standard components (Applications, Brokers, Nodes, Libraries) are evaluated based on Reverse PageRank, normalized in-degree, and Enhanced Cascade Depth Potential. Topic components are evaluated using Fan-Out Criticality (FOC) and topic-specific cascade potential.

**Standard Formula (Applications, Brokers, Nodes, Libraries):**

$$
R(v) = 0.45 \times \text{RPR}(v) + 0.30 \times \text{DG-in}(v) + 0.25 \times \text{CDPot-enh}(v)
$$

Where:
- $\text{RPR}(v)$ is the Reverse PageRank (transitive cascade reach).
- $\text{DG-in}(v)$ is the normalized in-degree (immediate blast radius).
- $\text{CDPot-enh}(v)$ is the Enhanced Cascade Depth Potential:

$$
\text{CDPot-enh}(v) = \min\left(\text{CDPot-base}(v) \times (1 + \text{MPCI}(v)), 1.0\right)
$$

$$
\text{CDPot-base}(v) = \frac{\text{RPR}(v) + \text{DG-in}(v)}{2} \times \left(1 - \min\left(\frac{\text{DG-out-raw}(v)}{\max(\text{DG-in-raw}(v), \epsilon)}, 1\right)\right)
$$

  with $\text{MPCI}(v)$ as the Multi-Path Coupling Index, and $\text{DG-out-raw}(v)$ / $\text{DG-in-raw}(v)$ as the raw integer degree metrics.

**Topic Formula:**

$$
R\text{-topic}(v) = 0.50 \times \text{FOC}(v) + 0.50 \times \text{CDPot-topic}(v)
$$

Where:
- $\text{FOC}(v)$ is the Fan-Out Criticality (log1p of message frequency $\times$ subscriber count).
- $\text{CDPot-topic}(v) = \text{FOC}(v) \times (1 - \min(\text{publisher-count-norm}(v), 1))$ represents topic fan-out depth.

### Maintainability

Maintainability measures how structurally embedded a component is in the topology, capturing static code fragility and deployment-coupling risk. It integrates betweenness centrality, efferent coupling, a Code Quality Penalty (CQP—incorporating cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, LCOM, and imports), topological instability, and the clustering coefficient.

**Formula:**

$$
M(v) = 0.35 \times \text{BT}(v) + 0.30 \times w\text{-out}(v) + 0.15 \times \text{CQP}(v) + 0.12 \times \text{CouplingRisk-enh}(v) + 0.08 \times (1 - \text{CC}(v))
$$

Where:
- $\text{BT}(v)$ is the betweenness centrality (fraction of shortest dependency paths passing through $v$).
- $w\text{-out}(v)$ is the QoS-weighted out-degree (efferent coupling).
- $\text{CQP}(v)$ is the Code Quality Penalty (only for Application and Library nodes; 0 otherwise):

$$
\text{CQP}(v) = 0.10 \times \text{loc-norm}(v) + 0.35 \times \text{complexity-norm}(v) + 0.30 \times \text{instability-code}(v) + 0.25 \times \text{lcom-norm}(v)
$$

- $\text{CouplingRisk-enh}(v)$ is the Enhanced Coupling Risk:

$$
\text{CouplingRisk-enh}(v) = \min\left(1.0, \text{CouplingRisk-base}(v) \times (1 + \Delta \times \text{path-complexity}(v))\right)
$$

$$
\text{CouplingRisk-base}(v) = 1 - |2 \times \text{Instability-topo}(v) - 1|
$$

$$
\text{Instability-topo}(v) = \frac{\text{DG-out-raw}(v)}{\text{DG-in-raw}(v) + \text{DG-out-raw}(v) + \epsilon}
$$

  with the coupling path delta $\Delta = 0.10$.
- $\text{CC}(v)$ is the clustering coefficient (measuring local redundancy).

### Availability

Availability measures whether a component is a structural single point of failure (SPOF). It combines directed articulation point scores, QoS-scaled SPOF severity, bridge ratios, connectivity degradation, and operational priority weights.

**Formula:**

$$
A(v) = 0.35 \times \text{AP}\text{-c-directed}(v) + 0.25 \times \text{QSPOF}(v) + 0.25 \times \text{BR}(v) + 0.10 \times \text{CDI}(v) + 0.05 \times w(v)
$$

Where:
- $\text{AP}\text{-c-directed}(v)$ is the directed articulation point score (reachability-based SPOF signal).
- $\text{QSPOF}(v) = \text{AP}\text{-c-directed}(v) \times w(v)$ is the QoS-weighted SPOF severity.
- $\text{BR}(v)$ is the bridge ratio (fraction of non-redundant edges).
- $\text{CDI}(v)$ is the Connectivity Degradation Index (path elongation on removal).
- $w(v)$ is the component's operational QoS weight.

### Vulnerability

Vulnerability measures how attractive a component is as an adversarial target. It is calculated using reverse eigenvector centrality, reverse closeness centrality, and QoS-weighted in-degree (QADS).

**Formula:**

$$
V(v) = 0.40 \times \text{REV}(v) + 0.35 \times \text{RCL}(v) + 0.25 \times w\text{-in}(v)
$$

Where:
- $\text{REV}(v)$ is the Reverse Eigenvector Centrality (transitive compromise reach on $G^T$).
- $\text{RCL}(v)$ is the Reverse Closeness Centrality (adversarial reach speed via harmonic centrality on $G^T$).
- $w\text{-in}(v)$ is the QoS-weighted in-degree (QADS: QoS-weighted Attack-Dependent Surface).

### Overall Criticality Score

The overall criticality score combines the four dimensions. Availability dominates because structural SPOF failure partitions the graph with certainty, whereas cascade propagation and coupling risks are probabilistic.

**AHP-Weighted Composite Formula:**

$$
Q(v) = 0.43 \times A(v) + 0.24 \times R(v) + 0.17 \times M(v) + 0.16 \times V(v)
$$

Alternatively, an equal-weight baseline (0.25 each) can be activated for baseline comparisons:

$$
Q\_{\text{equal}}(v) = 0.25 \times A(v) + 0.25 \times R(v) + 0.25 \times M(v) + 0.25 \times V(v)
$$




### Criticality Classification (Adaptive Box-Plot)

Scores are mapped to five criticality tiers using adaptive box-plot thresholding derived from the system's own score distribution:

| Level | Threshold |
|:---|:---|
| **CRITICAL** | Score > Q3 + 1.5 * IQR |
| **HIGH** | Q3 < Score <= Upper Fence |
| **MEDIUM** | Median < Score <= Q3 |
| **LOW** | Q1 < Score <= Median |
| **MINIMAL** | Score <= Q1 |

> [!NOTE]
> For small topologies (fewer than 12 components), the box-plot method falls back to fixed-percentile classification (top 10% $\rightarrow$ CRITICAL).

### RMAV Interpretation Triage Patterns

The four-dimensional criticality signature profiles the exact nature of architectural risk:

| Pattern | R | M | A | V | Risk Type | Recommended Action |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|:---|
| **Total Hub** | H | H | H | H | Catastrophic Hub | Introduce structural redundancy + network isolation + hardening |
| **Reliability Hub** | H | L | L | L | Wide Cascade Propagator | Implement retry logic, circuit breakers, and back-pressure |
| **Bottleneck** | L | H | L | L | High Change Fragility | Extract clean interface boundaries and reduce efferent coupling |
| **SPOF** | L | L | H | L | High Availability Risk | Introduce redundant instances or active-passive failover |
| **Attack Target** | L | L | L | H | High Attack Exposure | Enforce zero-trust boundaries and isolate network paths |
| **Fragile Hub** | H | L | H | L | Multi-Channel Cascade Sink | Reduce shared-topic count between subscriber/publisher pairs |
| **Exposed Bottleneck** | L | H | L | H | Vulnerable Bottleneck | Refactor code quality issues and shield component interfaces |

### GNN Prediction (Step 3 Predict)
 
The optional inductive Predict stage refines the deterministic RMAV scores by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (trained on simulation ground-truth impact) to perform GNN-only criticality predictions.

## Empirical Results

The methodology has been validated across eight domain scenarios (including autonomous vehicles, IoT, high-frequency trading, healthcare, and air traffic management):

| Metric | Target | Achieved |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Spearman $\rho(Q^*, I^*)$ overall | $\ge 0.85$ | **> 0.87** |
| Spearman $\rho(Q^*, I^*)$ at large scale (150–300+ nodes) | — | **0.943** |
| Overall F1-score | $\ge 0.90$ | **> 0.90** |
| Predictive Gain (PG) vs. degree baseline | $> 0.03$ | **> 0.03** |
| Best prediction layer | — | Application layer outperforms infrastructure layer |
| Scale effect | — | Prediction accuracy improves with system size |

## Installation & Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** (Virtual environment recommended)
- **Neo4j 5.x** (With GDS and APOC plugins enabled)
- **Node.js 18+** (Frontend dashboard execution only)

### 1. Neo4j Database Setup

The recommended way to run Neo4j locally with GDS (Graph Data Science) and APOC is via Docker:

```bash
docker run -d --name neo4j \
  -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
  -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \
  neo4j:2026.02.2
```

> [!WARNING]
> The default credentials (`neo4j` / `password`) are for local development only. Change these in the root `.env` file before shared deployments.

### 2. Backend & CLI Installation

Initialize a virtual environment, install PyTorch (with PyG dependencies), and install the CLI/SDK package in editable mode:

```bash
# Set up virtual environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv

```

### 5. Running Tests

```bash
pytest                # Run all tests
pytest -x             # Halt execution on first failure
pytest -k "reliability" # Run tests matching name pattern
```

---

## Anti-Pattern Detection

The `AntiPatternDetector` reviews RMAV scoring results and flags structural deficiencies in CI/CD pipelines.

| Anti-Pattern | Trigger Condition | Severity |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **SPOF** | Component is a directed articulation point | CRITICAL |
| **FAILURE_HUB** | $R(v) \ge$ CRITICAL threshold | CRITICAL |
| **GOD_COMPONENT** | $M(v) \ge$ CRITICAL and betweenness centrality $> 0.3$ | CRITICAL |
| **TARGET** | $V(v) \ge$ CRITICAL threshold | CRITICAL |
| **SYSTEMIC_RISK** | CRITICAL components account for $> 20\%$ of system | CRITICAL |
| **BRIDGE_EDGE** | Edge is a graph bridge | HIGH |
| **EXPOSURE** | $V(v) ==$ HIGH and closeness centrality $> 0.6$ | HIGH |
| **CYCLE** | Strongly Connected Component size $\ge 2$ nodes | HIGH |
| **HUB_AND_SPOKE** | Clustering coefficient $< 0.1$ and degree centrality $> 3$ | MEDIUM |
| **CHAIN** | Weakly connected sequence length $\ge 4$ nodes | MEDIUM |

> [!TIP]
> Detection runs return exit codes (0: clean, 1: warnings/smells, 2: critical/high patterns detected) suitable for pre-merge gates.

---

## Python SDK (`saag`)

The `saag` package exposes a fluent programmatic builder API for custom scripting:

```python
import saag

# Run Analyze + Simulate + Validate + Visualize in a fluent chain
result = (
    saag.Pipeline.from_json("data/system.json", clear=True)
        .analyze(layer="app")          # Deterministic structural metrics & RMAV
        .simulate(layer="app", mode="exhaustive") # Ground-truth simulation
        .validate()                    # Statistical validation
        .visualize(output="output/report.html") # Renders dashboard
        .run()
)

print(f"Spearman ρ = {result.validation.overall.spearman:.3f}")
print(f"F1-Score   = {result.validation.overall.f1:.3f}")
```

### Key SDK Classes

## Research Context

<!-- 
This framework is the software artifact for the PhD dissertation **"Graph-Based Modeling and Analysis of Distributed Publish-Subscribe Systems"** at Istanbul Technical University, Department of Computer Engineering.

The underlying methodology was peer-reviewed and published at:

> **IEEE International Conference on Recent Advances in Systems Science and Engineering (RASSE 2025)**
> *A Graph-Based Dependency Analysis Method for Identifying Critical Components in Distributed Publish-Subscribe Systems*
-->

The primary research contribution is the demonstration that **topological graph metrics can reliably predict real-world failure impact without runtime instrumentation**, validated empirically across multiple application domains and scale dimensions.

Key methodological contributions:
- **Six dependency derivation rules** making pub-sub logical dependencies explicit.
- **The RMAV quality model** decomposing criticality into orthogonal, actionable dimensions.
- **The MPCI metric** (Multi-Path Coupling Index) measuring coupling intensity.
- **The directed $AP_c$ score** correctly capturing directed single points of failure.
- **Adaptive box-plot classification** determining system-relative thresholds.
- **Empirical independence guarantee** structurally separating predictor and simulation views.
